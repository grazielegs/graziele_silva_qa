Hi **Ormuco Team**, I am **Graziele** and nice to meet you!

## Criteria of Choice - Cypress.io

Cypress is a relatively new framework and solves some of the problems older solutions faced in the area of test automation.
This framework has a different architecture of Selenium for example, a very famous tool for this type of task and in addition is open source.
It is much faster to write tests and easier to configure the execution environment. Using Selenium for example, it is necessary to have locally the drivers for the most diverse browsers to run tests in the WebDriver.
Further advantages can be read in the official [Cypress documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress.html#Features).

# Execution of this project

To execute this project, you need to follow some requeriments, basically the installation of Cypress:

## Requeriments

 - Node.Js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
 - Follow the *Installation Guide of Cypress* - [https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#System-requirements)
 
	 ### Installation Guide 
	 First, access your project path:
	``cd /your/project/path
	``
	And install Cypress throught npm package:
	``npm install cypress --save-dev
	``
	And so, execute Cypress using npx:
	``npx cypress open``

## Considerations
One of the itens from the Technical Assessment is the maintainability of the test code. What I would to is add an 'data-testid' atributes to select the itens of the website and if the selectors change, the test will stay intact.

# Thanks and my best regards!
